.SH "NAME"
\fBbb_fitness\fR \- Grow a random graph with the fitness model
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBbb_fitness\fR \fIN\fR \fIm\fR \fIn0\fR [SHOW]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBbb_fitness\fR grows an undirected random scale\-free graph with \fIN\fR nodes using the fitness model proposed by Bianconi and Barabasi\. The initial network is a clique of \fIn0\fR nodes, and each new node creates \fIm\fR new edges\. The probability that a new node create an edge to node \fBj\fR is proportional to

.P
where \fBa_j\fR is the attractiveness (fitness) of node \fBj\fR\. The values of node attractiveness are sampled uniformly in the interval [0,1]\.
.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.
.TP
\fIN\fR
Number of nodes of the final graph\.
.
.TP
\fIm\fR
Number of edges created by each new node\.
.
.TP
\fIn0\fR
Number of nodes in the initial (seed) graph\.
.
.TP
SHOW
If the fourth parameter is equal to \fBSHOW\fR, the values of node attractiveness are printed on STDERR\.
.
.SH "OUTPUT"
\fBbb_fitness\fR prints on STDOUT the edge list of the final graph\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
The following command:

.
.nf

    $ bb_fitness 10000 3 4 > bb_fitness_10000_3_4\.txt
.
.fi
.

.
.P
uses the fitness model to create a random graph with \fIN=10000\fR nodes, where each new node creates \fIm=3\fR new edges and the initial seed network is a ring of \fIn0=5\fR nodes\. The edge list of the resulting graph is saved in the file \fBbb_fitness_10000_3_4\.txt\fR (notice the redirection operator \fB>\fR)\. The command:

.P
will do the same as above, but it will additionally save the values of node fitness in the file \fBbb_fitness_10000_3_4\.txt_fitness\fR (notice the redirection operator \fB2>\fR, that redirects the STDERR to the specified file)\.
