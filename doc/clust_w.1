.SH "NAME"
\fBclust_w\fR \- Compute the graph and node clustering of weighted graphs
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBclust_w\fR \fIgraph_in\fR [SHOW]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBclust_w\fR computes the clustering coefficient of the undirected and weighted graph given as input in the file \fIgraph_in\fR\. The program uses the definition of weighted clustering proposed by Barrat, Barthelemy, Pastor\-Satorras ans Vespignani\. If \fBSHOW\fR is provided as a second parameter, the program prints on STDERR the label, degree, and clustering coefficient of all the nodes in \fIgraph_in\fR\.
.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.
.TP
\fIgraph_in\fR
undirected and weighted input graph (edge list)\. If it is equal to \fB\-\fR (dash), read the edge list from STDIN\.
.
.TP
SHOW
If the second (optional) parameter is equal to \fBSHOW\fR, the program will dump on the standard error the label, degree, and clustering coefficient of each node in \fIgraph_in\fR\.
.
.SH "OUTPUT"
If only \fIgraph_in\fR is specified, then the output is a single line, containing the clustering coefficient of the undirected and weighted graph provided as input\. If \fBSHOW\fR is specified, the program will print on the standard output one line for each node, in the format:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

node_1 k_1 c_1
node_2 k_2 c_2
node_3 k_3 c_3
 \.\.\.\.

.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
where \fBnode_1\fR is the label of the node, \fBk_1\fR is its degree, and \fBc_1\fR is its node clustering coefficient\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
The most simple way of using \fBclust\fR is to compute only the clustering coefficient of a graph\. For instance, the command:
.

.
.nf

      $ clust_w US_airports\.net
      0\.01034196
      $
.

.

.P
computes the weighted clustering coefficient of the graph \fBUS_airports\.net\fR (the US air transportation network)\. In order to obtain the weighted clustering coefficient of all the nodes, we should use:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

      $ clust_w US_airports\.net SHOW
      0 145 0\.30493676524961
      1 136 0\.364315549333
      2 132 0\.3443612411812
      3 76 0\.52204673222936
      \.\.\.\.
      497 2 1
      498 2 1
      499 1 0
      0\.65111741
      $
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The last line printed on output is still the value of the weighted clustering coefficient of the graph, while the previous 500 lines (which are printed on STDERR) contain the label, degree, and weighted clustering coefficient of each node\. For instance, the first line indicates that node \fB0\fR has degree equal to \fB145\fR and clustering coefficient equal to \fB0\.30493676524961\fR\. It is more convenient to save the values of node clustering coefficients in a file, e\.g\.:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

      $ clust_w US_airports\.net SHOW 2> node_clust_w
      0\.65111741
      $
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
In this case, the program prints on output only the weighted graph clustering coefficient \fB0\.65111741\fR, while the node clustering coefficients are saved on the file \fBnode_clust_w\fR (notice the syntax \fB2> node_clust_w\fR, which redirects the STDERR to the file \fBnode_clust_w\fR)\.
