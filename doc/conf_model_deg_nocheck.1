.SH "NAME"
\fBconf_model_deg_nocheck\fR \- Sample a multigraph from the configuration model
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBconf_model_deg_nocheck\fR \fIdegs\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBconf_model_deg_nocheck\fR samples an undirected multigraph (i\.e\., a graph that might contain self\-loops multiple edges) from the configuration model associated to the degree sequence provided in the input file \fIdegs\fR\.
.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.
.TP
\fIdegs\fR
The name of the file containing the degree sequence\. If \fIdegs\fR is equal to \'\-\' (dash) the degree sequence is read from STDIN (standard input)\.
.
.SH "OUTPUT"
\fBconf_model_deg_nocheck\fR prints on output the edge list of the sampled graph\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Let us assume that the file \fBAS\-20010316\.net_degs\fR contains the degree sequence of the data set \fBAS\-20010316\.net\fR (the graph of the Internet at AS level in March 2001)\. In this case, the degree sequence is too constrained, since the maximum degree (2277) is much larger than the structural cut\-off (see \fIREFERENCES\fR below)\. However, since \fBconf_model_deg_nocheck\fR allows for self\-loops and multiple edges, it always finds a multigraph:
