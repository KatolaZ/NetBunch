.SH "NAME"
\fBba\fR \- Grow a Barabasi\-Albert scale\-free random graph
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBba\fR \fIN\fR \fIm\fR \fIn0\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBba\fR grows an undirected random scale\-free graph with \fIN\fR nodes using the linear preferential attachment model proposed by Barabasi and Albert\. The initial network is a ring of \fIn0\fR nodes, and each new node creates \fIm\fR new edges\. The resulting graph will have a scale\-free degree distribution, whose exponent converges to \fBgamma=3\.0\fR for large \fIN\fR\.
.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.
.TP
\fIN\fR
Number of nodes of the final graph\.
.
.TP
\fIm\fR
Number of edges created by each new node\.
.
.TP
\fIn0\fR
Number of nodes in the initial (seed) graph\.
.
.SH "OUTPUT"
\fBba\fR prints on STDOUT the edge list of the final graph\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"

.P
creates a Barabasi\-Albert scale\-free graph with \fIN=10000\fR nodes, where each new node creates \fIm=3\fR new edges and the initial seed network is a ring of \fIn0=5\fR nodes\. The edge list of the graph is saved in the file \fBba_10000_3_5\.txt\fR (thanks to the redirection operator \fB>\fR)\.
