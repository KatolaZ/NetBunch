er_B(1) -- Sample a random graph from the Erdos-Renyi model B
======

## SYNOPSIS

`er_B` <N> _p_ [<fileout>]

## DESCRIPTION

`er_B` samples a random graph from the Erdos-Renyi model B, i.e. a
graph with <N> nodes where each of the <N(N-1)/2> edges is created
independently with probability _p_. The program dumps the edge list of
the resulting graph on output. If the optional <fileout> is provided,
the output is written on a file with that name.

## PARAMETERS

* <N>:
    Number of nodes in the final graph.

* _p_:
    Edge probability.

* <fileout>:
    The (optional) name of the filename where the edge list of the
    graph will be saved.

## EXAMPLES

The following command:

          $ er_B 1000 0.006

samples an undirected random network with <N=1000> nodes where each
possible edge is created with probability _p=0.006_.  The output of
the command `er_B` will be the edge-list of the resulting graph, where
each (undirected) edge is reported only once. In order to be useful,
such edge-list should be saved into a file. The following command:

          $ er_B 1000 0.006 > er_B_1000_0.006.net

will save the resulting graph in the file
er\_B\_1000\_0.006.net. Notice the usage of the symbol "\>" to
redirect the output of the program to a file.
