===== DOWNLOAD =====

NetBunch can be downloaded from the official website of the book:

  http://www.complex-networks.net

NetBunch binaries are available for Windows (64bit) and Mac OS. Source 
files are available from the same website, and can be used to compile 
NetBunch on Linux and unix-like operating systems (but also on Windows
and Mac OS, if you like). 

If you use a program included in NetBunch, please add a citation to
the textbook:

  "Complex Networks: Principles, Methods and Application"
  V. Latora, V. Nicosia, G. Russo, Cambridge University 
  Press (2017), ISBN: 9781107103184

and to the relevant References indicated in the corresponding source
files.


===== INSTALLATION =====


=== Binaries (Windows / Mac OS) ===

To use the binary packages for Windows and/or Mac OS, just download
the correct version from http://www.complex-networks.net and unzip the
archive in a directory of your system. The zip file includes:

- all the binaries (in the folder 'bin')
- the documentation in HTML and man format (in the folder 'netbunch-doc')
- additional files referred in the manpages (in the folder 'netbunch-examples')

All the programs can be used from the command line, i.e., 'cmd',
'command', 'PowerShell' (under Windows), or from iTerm or other
virtual terminal emulators (under Mac OS). 

If you unpack the zip archive in NETBUNCH_FOLDER, you might want to add 
NETBUNCH_FOLDER/bin to your PATH.


=== Installing from sources (Linux / unix / Windows / Mac OS) ===

All the programs in NetBunch are written in ANSI C99, and require only
an ANSI C99 compiler (i.e., there is no additional dependency).
NetBunch has been compiled and tested with 'gcc', 'clang' (LLVM),
'tcc' (tiny C compiler) under Linux, with 'gcc' and 'clang' under Mac
OS, and with MSYS2 (64-bit compiler based on gcc, see
http://www.msys2.org/) under Windows.

Due to the absence of dependencies, it should be possible to compile
NetBunch with any generic ANSI C99 compiler.

To install NetBunch from sources:

- Download the source package from http://www.complex-networks.net

- unpack the tar.gz (or zip) archive in a folder 

- change to that folder and use the standard:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install


N.B.: The documentation of all the programs in NetBunch is written in
Markdown. The build system uses 'ronn' (a ruby utility for document
generation) to convert the markdown files into manpages and HTML
files. Compiled manpages and html files are distributed along with the
source files, but if you want to rebuild the manpages you must have
'ronn' (and all its dependencies) installed.
